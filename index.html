      <h1> Introduction </h1>
      <p> Hello! I'm Bonnie, an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer. I love long walks on the beach, great  conversations, and <strong>corgis</strong>. Place me in a coffee shop with a latte and you'll have me working away until the sun sets.</p>
      
      <p> I love everything that involves <strong>great design</strong>, and as a designer myself that is what I always strive for in all my projects.</p>
      
      <p> I am super excited to start my journey with <strong>Thinkful</strong>, and cannot wait to accomplish amazing things!</p>

      <h1> My Roots </h1>
      <p> I am from a town just west from <strong>Toronto</strong>, called Scarborough, and currently reside in Markham, a town north of where I used to live. My educational background is in <strong>Interior Design</strong>, and I still hold dear to all the principles I have learnt in design school.</p>
      
      <p> Moving away from Interior Design, I wish to become a web developer and ultimately, would like to focus on <strong>interaction design</strong>.

      <h1> More About Me </h1>
      <h2> What is your favourite type of dog?</h2>
      <p> <strong>Corgi.</strong> I cannot emphasize how awesome they are. <strong>Very</strong> awesome. <em>Absolutely.</em> I do have a dog that is not a corgi but he doesn't know that.</p>
      <h2> What's your dream job? </h2>
      <p> As farfetched as it sounds, I would hopefully one day be able to <strong>integrate</strong> my traditional background in Interior Design/ Architecture with web development/ interactive design!</p>
      <h2>What songs are you listening to currently?</h2>
      <p> I'm actually going to see <strong>Keith Ape</strong> in concert this upcoming Thursday, so I am getting myself hyped up for that listening to his totally awesome song - <strong> It G Ma. </strong></p>
